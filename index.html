    <h2>Let's introduce myself</h2>

<p>Hello dear friends! My name is Margaux.
I've never thought I could study graphic design, but here I am, a 23 woman actually studying in ECV Bordeaux (School Of Visual Communication).
Applying for a mastere education, I took an option which is to learn Design & Strategy in Shanghai for 4 months with the ESSCA (School of commercials sciences of Angers). I'm supposed to get there in January, and then I continue the final year in ECV Paris.
Ok for my introduction, but what about my work ?
All my project have been made during my studies, from my first diploma to my futur second diploma (2018). If I had put them here, this is because I think people that watch my Behance Profile can see who I am, what I can do and what I love to do. You may see a progress between the first ones I put online and those I recently put.
About what I love in graphic Design.
Curious and open-minded, I have quickly understood that each work can offer me something and that I can leave something from me in all of them. I like doing branding, playing with typefaces, choosing colors, create patterns, etc. Actually, I like creating the background (concept, philosophy) as much as the form.
Enjoy my profile ;) see ya!</p>

<h2>In the United States</h2>
<p>In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.

  <h2>Your increasingly obsolete</h2>
  <p>Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.
  These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
  We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.
